# PriceTracker #

This is a re-write of my *golang* project, [pricetracker](https://github.com/xiahongze/pricetracker) in pure Python. Here are some improvements:

- fastapi with OpenAPI integration
- SQL as backend supported by sqlalchemy
- better scraping with Selenium
- easy configuration with YAML config file

[Pushover](https://pushover.net/) integration is still supported by default.
